# COVID-19_Impact_Goods_and_People_Mobility
This project was my team's submission to Columbia Data Science Hackathon 2020 （2nd place). Below is an overview of the project:

• Evaluated and predicted COVID-19 impact on goods and people mobility with Google BigQuery Public Datasets.

• Conducted time series analysis with Python (NumPy, Pandas, Pyramid-Arima) and quantified COVID impact – industry indexes
dropped as much as 61% from predicted growth.

• Trained decision tree models (Sklearn, XGBoost) to predict residential index and fuel usage if total U.S. cases reach 9 million.

Please note that the code posted was the result of a collective team effort.
